# Creating and Managing Email Accounts

Professional email addresses using your own domain (like `you@yourdomain.com`) enhance your brand's credibility. This guide covers everything you need to know about setting up and managing email accounts with Xenum Hosting.

## Creating Email Accounts in DirectAdmin

Follow these steps to create new email accounts through your hosting control panel:

1. **Log in to DirectAdmin** using your credentials.
2. Navigate to **Email Management** → **Email Accounts**.
3. Under **Create Account**:
   * Enter the desired username (the part before @).
   * Select the domain from the dropdown if you have multiple domains.
   * Create a strong password (or use the password generator).
   * Set a quota (mailbox size limit) - check your hosting plan for available space.
4. Click **Create Account**.

Your new email address will be immediately active and ready to use.

**Managing Existing Accounts:**
* **Change Password:** Click the key icon next to an account.
* **Modify Quota:** Click the disk icon next to an account.
* **Delete Account:** Click the trash icon (warning: this permanently deletes all emails).

**Troubleshooting:**
* **"Account Already Exists" Error:** Choose a different username.
* **Quota Issues:** Ensure you haven't exceeded your hosting plan's email account limits.
* **Password Rejected:** Use a stronger password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
