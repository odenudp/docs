# Troubleshooting and Support

Even the most reliable hosting services can sometimes present challenges. Knowing how to troubleshoot common issues and how to effectively contact support can save you time and minimize disruption. This guide provides resources for diagnosing problems and outlines the best ways to get help from the Xenum Hosting team.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Before contacting support, consider these common troubleshooting steps:

1.  **Clear Your Browser Cache:** Sometimes display issues or outdated content are simply cached in your browser. Try clearing your cache and reloading the page.
2.  **Check Error Logs:**
    *   **Website Errors:** Look for `error_log` files in your website directories via File Manager.
    *   **Server Errors (DirectAdmin):** Check **System Info & Files -> Site Summary / Statistics / Logs** for specific error logs.
    *   **WordPress Debug Mode:** Enable `WP_DEBUG` in your `wp-config.php` file to see detailed PHP errors.
3.  **Review Recent Changes:** Did the issue start after installing a new plugin, theme, or making configuration changes? Try reverting the change.
4.  **Check Resource Usage:** Log in to DirectAdmin and check your **Resource Usage** (CPU, Memory, I/O, Entry Processes). High usage can cause slowness or errors.
5.  **Verify DNS Propagation:** If you recently changed DNS settings or nameservers, use a tool like `dnschecker.org` to ensure the changes have propagated globally.
6.  **Consult Specific Documentation:** Refer to the relevant sections in these docs (e.g., WordPress errors, SSL issues, Email configuration) for targeted troubleshooting steps.

**Common Error Guides:**
*   **404 Not Found:** Check URLs, file paths, and `.htaccess` rewrite rules.
*   **500 Internal Server Error:** Check `.htaccess`, file permissions, script errors, and resource limits. Review server error logs.
*   **Error Establishing Database Connection:** Verify database credentials in config files (`wp-config.php`, etc.), check if the database server is running, and ensure the user has privileges.
*   **Slow Website:** Use tools like GTmetrix, check resource usage, optimize images/code, consider caching.
