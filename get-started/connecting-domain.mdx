# Connecting a Domain to Your Hosting with Xenum Hosting

Connect your domain to Xenum Hosting ([xenumhosting.com](http://xenumhosting.com)) to make your website live. This guide includes detailed steps and troubleshooting tips.

## Prerequisites

- A registered domain name (e.g., from Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains).

- Access to your domain registrar’s DNS settings.

- An active Xenum Hosting account.

## Steps to Connect Your Domain

\<Steps\>

  \<Step title="Purchase or Verify Your Domain"\>

    If you don’t have a domain, purchase one from a registrar like Namecheap or Google Domains.  

    If you already own a domain, log in to your registrar’s dashboard to access DNS settings.

  \</Step\>

  \<Step title="Update Nameservers"\>

    In your registrar’s DNS settings, update the nameservers to Xenum Hosting’s:

    - **Primary Nameserver**: `ns1.xenumhosting.com`

    - **Secondary Nameserver**: `ns2.xenumhosting.com`

    Save the changes. This may take up to 48 hours to propagate.

  \</Step\>

  \<Step title="Add Domain in Xenum Hosting Dashboard"\>

    Log in to your Xenum Hosting dashboard at [xenumhosting.com/login](https://xenumhosting.com/login).  

    Navigate to **Domains \> Add Domain**.  

    Enter your domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) and click "Add."  

    Xenum Hosting will verify the nameserver settings.

  \</Step\>

  \<Step title="Wait for DNS Propagation"\>

    DNS propagation can take 24–48 hours. Check the status in your Xenum Hosting dashboard under **Domains**.  

    You can also use a DNS checker tool like `dnschecker.org` to monitor propagation.

  \</Step\>

  \<Step title="Verify Your Website"\>

    Once propagation is complete, visit your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) to ensure it’s live.  

    If it’s not working, proceed to the troubleshooting section below.

  \</Step\>

\</Steps\>

## Troubleshooting

- **Domain Not Resolving**: Ensure the nameservers are correctly set to `ns1.xenumhosting.com` and `ns2.xenumhosting.com`. Double-check for typos.

- **Propagation Delays**: Propagation can take longer depending on your registrar. Wait up to 48 hours, then contact support if the issue persists.

- **Error Messages**: If you see a "Site Not Found" error, ensure the domain is added in your Xenum Hosting dashboard and that your website files are uploaded to the `public_html` directory.

## Additional Tips

- **Set Up SSL**: After connecting your domain, secure it with a free SSL certificate by following [Installing a Free SSL Certificate](/security/installing-ssl).

- **Test with a Subdomain**: If you’re not ready to change your main domain’s nameservers, test with a subdomain (e.g., `test.yourdomain.com`) by creating an A record pointing to your Xenum Hosting IP address (available in your dashboard).

## Next Steps

- Upload your website files using DirectAdmin by following [Using DirectAdmin Control Panel](/getting-started/using-directadmin).
