# Using DirectAdmin Control Panel with Xenum Hosting

Manage your hosting on [xenumhosting.com](http://xenumhosting.com) using the DirectAdmin control panel. This guide provides detailed instructions, navigation tips, and common tasks.

## Accessing DirectAdmin

\<Steps\>

  \<Step title="Log In to DirectAdmin"\>

    Open your browser and navigate to `xenumhosting.com:2222`.  

    Enter your username and password, which were sent to your email `support@xenumhosting.com`) during account setup.  

    If you’ve lost your credentials, use the "Forgot Password" link or contact [[support@xenumhosting.com](mailto:support@xenumhosting.com)](mailto:support@xenumhosting.com).

  \</Step\>

  \<Step title="Understand the Dashboard Layout"\>

    The DirectAdmin dashboard is divided into sections:

    - **Account Manager**: Manage domains, emails, and databases.

    - **File Manager**: Upload and manage website files.

    - **Advanced Features**: Access tools like SSL Certificates, Cloudflare, and Imunify360.

    - **System Info & Files**: View server stats and logs.

  \</Step\>

  \<Step title="Upload Website Files"\>

    Navigate to **File Manager** in the dashboard.  

    Open the `public_html` directory, which is where your website files should reside.  

    Click "Upload Files" and select your website files (e.g., `index.html`) from your computer.  

    Ensure your main page is named `index.html` or `index.php` to load by default.

  \</Step\>

  \<Step title="Explore Common Tasks"\>

    - **Create Email Accounts**: Go to **Email Manager \> Email Accounts** (see [Creating Email Accounts in DirectAdmin](/email/creating-email)).  

    - **Install WordPress**: Use **Softaculous Apps Installer** under **Advanced Features** (see [Installing WordPress with Softaculous](/wordpress/installing-wordpress)).  

    - **Secure Your Site**: Enable SSL under **Advanced Features \> SSL Certificates** (see [Installing a Free SSL Certificate](/security/installing-ssl)).

  \</Step\>

\</Steps\>

## Troubleshooting

- **Login Issues**: Ensure you’re using the correct port `2222`) and that your IP isn’t blocked by the server firewall. Contact support if needed.

- **File Upload Errors**: Check if you have sufficient storage space in your plan. Verify file permissions in File Manager (should be `644` for files, `755` for directories).

- **Website Not Loading**: Confirm your files are in `public_html` and that your domain is properly connected (see [Connecting a Domain to Your Hosting](/getting-started/connecting-domain)).

## Additional Tips

- **Backup Your Data**: Use **Backup Wizard** under **Account Manager** to create regular backups of your website files and databases.

- **Monitor Usage**: Check **System Info & Files \> Resource Usage** to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to avoid exceeding your plan limits.

- **Custom Configurations**: Advanced users can access **CustomBuild Options** to modify server settings like PHP versions (requires caution).

## Next Steps

- Install WordPress or another CMS by following [Installing WordPress with Softaculous](/wordpress/installing-wordpress).

- Set up email accounts for your domain in [Creating Email Accounts in DirectAdmin](/email/creating-email).
