# Registering a New Domain Name

Your domain name is your unique address on the internet (e.g., `yourwebsite.com`). Registering the right domain is a key step in establishing your online presence. Xenum Hosting allows you to search for and register new domain names directly through the client area.

## 1. Searching for Available Domains

1.  **Log in to the Xenum Hosting Client Area.**
2.  Navigate to the **Domains** section (often labeled "Register a New Domain" or similar).
3.  Enter the domain name you desire into the search box.
4.  Select the desired extension(s) (e.g., `.com`, `.net`, `.org`) you want to check.
5.  Click **Search** or **Check Availability**.

The system will show you if the domain name is available for registration and list alternative suggestions if it's taken.

**Tips for Choosing a Domain:**
*   **Keep it Short & Memorable:** Easier for visitors to type and recall.
*   **Make it Relevant:** Reflect your brand, business, or website topic.
*   **Consider Keywords:** Can help slightly with SEO.
*   **Choose the Right Extension:** `.com` is most common, but others like `.org`, `.net`, `.co`, or country-specific extensions (`.ca`, `.uk`) might be suitable.
*   **Avoid Hyphens & Numbers (if possible):** Can be confusing.
*   **Check Trademarks:** Ensure your chosen name doesn't infringe on existing trademarks.

## 2. The Registration Process

1.  Once you find an available domain you like, click **Add to Cart** or **Register**.
2.  You may be prompted to choose the registration period (typically 1-10 years).
3.  **Configure Domain Settings:**
    *   **Nameservers:** By default, domains registered through Xenum Hosting will likely be pre-configured to use Xenum Hosting's nameservers (e.g., `ns1.xenumhosting.com`, `ns2.xenumhosting.com`). This is usually what you want if you're hosting the website with us. If you plan to host elsewhere, you can change these later.
    *   **WHOIS Information:** You must provide accurate contact information (Registrant, Admin, Tech contacts) for the domain registration record (WHOIS database). This includes name, address, email, and phone number.
    *   **WHOIS Privacy / ID Protection (Recommended):** Consider adding WHOIS Privacy. This service masks your personal contact details in the public WHOIS database, replacing them with the details of a proxy service, protecting you from spam and potential identity theft. There might be an additional fee for this service.
4.  Proceed to **Checkout**.
5.  Review your order and complete the payment.

## 3. Post-Registration Steps & DNS

*   **Confirmation:** You will receive email confirmation of your domain registration.
*   **Verification (Important):** ICANN (the organization governing domains) requires verification of the registrant email address for new registrations. You will receive an email with a verification link. **You must click this link within a specific timeframe (usually 15 days) to avoid domain suspension.**
*   **DNS Configuration:** Since the domain is registered with Xenum Hosting and likely using our nameservers, the basic DNS records (like the A record pointing to your hosting server IP) might be automatically set up. You can manage these records via:
    *   **DirectAdmin:** If your hosting plan includes DNS management (Account Manager -> DNS Management).
    *   **Client Area:** Some domain management functions might be available directly in the client area's domain section.
*   **Propagation:** While nameserver changes can take time, DNS records for newly registered domains using the provider's nameservers are often active very quickly.

## 4. Managing Your Registered Domain

You can manage your domain settings through the Xenum Hosting client area:

*   **Renewals:** Keep track of the expiration date and renew the domain before it expires. Consider enabling auto-renewal.
*   **Contact Information:** Update your WHOIS contact details if they change.
*   **Nameservers:** Change the nameservers if you decide to host your website elsewhere.
*   **DNS Records:** Manage A, CNAME, MX, TXT, and other records (if DNS hosting is managed here).
*   **Domain Locking:** Keep your domain locked to prevent unauthorized transfers.
*   **EPP Code / Auth Code:** Obtain this code if you need to transfer the domain away to another registrar.

**Troubleshooting Registration:**
*   **Payment Issues:** Ensure your payment method is valid and has sufficient funds.
*   **Domain Unavailable:** If the search showed it as available but registration failed, it might have been registered by someone else just moments before. Try searching again or choose a different name.
*   **Verification Email Not Received:** Check your spam folder. Ensure the registrant email address is correct in your client area profile. Contact support if it doesn't arrive.
*   **Domain Suspended:** Usually due to failed verification or non-payment for renewal.

Registering your domain through Xenum Hosting simplifies the process by keeping your domain and hosting management in one place.
