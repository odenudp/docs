# Website Migration Guide

Moving your existing website, emails, and domains to Xenum Hosting is a straightforward process when you follow these guidelines. This comprehensive migration guide will help you transfer your online presence with minimal downtime.

## Before You Begin

Before starting the migration process:

1. **Create a Backup**: Always create a complete backup of your current website, databases, emails, and important files.
2. **Check Disk Space**: Ensure your Xenum Hosting plan has sufficient disk space for all your content.
3. **Domain Status**: Verify your domain is unlocked at your current registrar if you plan to transfer it.
4. **Gather Information**: Collect FTP/SFTP credentials, database details, and email configurations from your current host.
5. **Plan for Downtime**: Schedule your migration during low-traffic periods to minimize disruption.

## Website Migration Process

### 1. Migrating Website Files

#### Using FTP/SFTP Method:

1. **Download Files from Current Host**:
   * Connect to your current hosting using an FTP client (like FileZilla)
   * Download all website files to your local computer

2. **Upload Files to Xenum Hosting**:
   * Log in to DirectAdmin
   * Navigate to **File Manager** or use FTP credentials provided in your welcome email
   * Upload all website files to the `public_html` directory (or appropriate subdirectory for addon domains)

**Troubleshooting**:
* **Connection Issues**: Verify FTP credentials and ensure your IP isn't blocked
* **Upload Failures**: Try uploading in smaller batches if you encounter timeouts
* **Permission Problems**: After uploading, check file permissions (typically 644 for files, 755 for directories)

### 2. Migrating Databases

1. **Export Database from Current Host**:
   * Access phpMyAdmin on your current hosting
   * Select the database to migrate
   * Click "Export" and choose "Quick" export method with SQL format
   * Save the .sql file to your computer

2. **Import Database to Xenum Hosting**:
   * Log in to DirectAdmin
   * Go to **MySQL Management**
   * Create a new database and user
   * Access phpMyAdmin for the new database
   * Click "Import" and select your .sql file
   * Click "Go" to start the import process

3. **Update Configuration Files**:
   * Update your website's configuration files (like `wp-config.php` for WordPress) with the new database details:
     ```php
     define('DB_NAME', 'new_database_name');
     define('DB_USER', 'new_database_username');
     define('DB_PASSWORD', 'new_database_password');
     define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
     ```

**Troubleshooting**:
* **Import Too Large**: Split large SQL files into smaller parts or increase PHP limits
* **Timeout Errors**: Contact support to temporarily increase PHP execution time
* **Database Connection Errors**: Double-check the database name, username, and password in configuration files

### 3. Migrating Email Accounts

1. **Create Email Accounts on Xenum Hosting**:
   * In DirectAdmin, go to **Email Management** â†’ **Email Accounts**
   * Create accounts matching those on your previous host
   * Set up strong passwords for each account

2. **Migrate Email Messages (Optional)**:
   * Configure both old and new email accounts in an email client like Thunderbird
   * Select and drag messages from old account folders to new account folders
   * For large mailboxes, consider using a dedicated email migration tool

**Troubleshooting**:
* **Missing Emails**: Check spam folders and ensure IMAP is enabled on both accounts
* **Authentication Failures**: Verify email credentials and server settings
* **Quota Issues**: Check if you've exceeded mailbox size limits

## Domain Transfer Process

### Option 1: Changing Nameservers (Keep Domain at Current Registrar)

1. **Get Xenum Hosting Nameservers**:
   * Find nameservers in your welcome email or client area (typically `ns1.xenumhosting.com` and `ns2.xenumhosting.com`)

2. **Update Nameservers at Your Registrar**:
   * Log in to your domain registrar
   * Find domain management or DNS settings
   * Replace current nameservers with Xenum Hosting nameservers
   * Save changes

3. **Wait for Propagation**:
   * DNS changes typically take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
   * You can check propagation status using online tools like `whatsmydns.net`

### Option 2: Full Domain Transfer to Xenum Hosting

1. **Prepare Domain for Transfer**:
   * Ensure domain is unlocked at current registrar
   * Disable privacy protection temporarily
   * Obtain authorization/EPP code from current registrar
   * Verify admin email address is correct

2. **Initiate Transfer in Xenum Hosting**:
   * Log in to Xenum Hosting client area
   * Select "Transfer Domains"
   * Enter domain name and authorization code
   * Complete the payment process

3. **Approve Transfer Request**:
   * Check admin email for transfer approval request
   * Follow instructions to approve the transfer
   * Wait for transfer to complete (typically 5-7 days)

**Troubleshooting**:
* **Transfer Rejected**: Ensure domain is unlocked and not within 60 days of registration or previous transfer
* **No Approval Email**: Check spam folder or contact current registrar
* **Failed Transfer**: Verify the authorization code is correct and not expired

## Post-Migration Checklist

After completing the migration:

1. **Test Website Functionality**:
   * Check all pages, forms, and interactive elements
   * Test on multiple browsers and devices
   * Verify all images and media files load correctly

2. **Test Email Functionality**:
   * Send and receive test emails
   * Check email forwarding and autoresponders if used
   * Verify spam filtering is working

3. **Update DNS Records if Needed**:
   * Set up any custom DNS records (MX, TXT, CNAME) that were on your previous host
   * Verify SSL certificate is working properly

4. **Monitor for Issues**:
   * Keep an eye on website performance for the first few days
   * Check server logs for any errors
