# How to Set Up Your Hosting Account

Welcome to Xenum Hosting! Activating your hosting account is the crucial first step towards building your online presence. This guide will walk you through the initial setup process, ensuring your account is ready and secure.

## 1. Check Your Welcome Email

Immediately after signing up for a Xenum Hosting plan, you should receive a welcome email. This email is very important as it contains:

*   Your login credentials (username and password) for the client area and potentially the control panel (like DirectAdmin).
*   Links to the client area login page.
*   Nameserver details (needed later for connecting your domain).
*   Links to support resources.

**Troubleshooting:** If you haven't received the welcome email within a few minutes, please check your spam or junk folder. If it's still missing, contact our support team for assistance.

## 2. Log In to the Client Area

Use the link and credentials from your welcome email to log in to the Xenum Hosting client area.

*   Navigate to the client area login page (e.g., `https://xenumhosting.com/login` - *confirm this link if different*).
*   Enter the username and password provided.

The client area is your central hub for managing your account details, services, billing, support tickets, and more.

## 3. Access Your Hosting Control Panel (DirectAdmin)

From the client area, you can typically access your hosting control panel. Xenum Hosting uses DirectAdmin. Look for a section like "My Services" or "Products", find your active hosting plan, and click a button like "Manage" or "Log in to DirectAdmin".

DirectAdmin is where you'll manage the technical aspects of your hosting: files, databases, email accounts, domains, SSL certificates, etc.

## 4. Secure Your Account: Change Your Password

For security reasons, it's highly recommended to change the default password provided in the welcome email immediately.

*   **In the Client Area:** Look for an "Account Settings" or "Security Settings" section where you can update your password.
*   **In DirectAdmin:** Find the "Password" or similar option, usually near the top right or under account settings.

Choose a strong, unique password combining uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information.

## 5. Familiarize Yourself with the Dashboards

Take a few minutes to explore both the client area and the DirectAdmin control panel.

*   **Client Area:** Note where to find your active services, billing information, support tickets, and account profile.
*   **DirectAdmin:** Identify key sections like File Manager, MySQL Management, Email Accounts, Domain Setup, and SSL Certificates. Understanding the layout now will save you time later.

**Congratulations!** Your Xenum Hosting account is now set up and secured. You're ready to proceed with connecting your domain and building your website.
