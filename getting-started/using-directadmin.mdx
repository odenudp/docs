# Using the DirectAdmin Control Panel

DirectAdmin is a powerful and user-friendly web hosting control panel provided with your Xenum Hosting account. It allows you to manage all aspects of your hosting service through a graphical interface, without needing command-line knowledge. This guide will introduce you to the main features and common tasks you can perform in DirectAdmin.

## Accessing DirectAdmin

You can typically access DirectAdmin in two ways:

1.  **Through the Client Area:** Log in to your Xenum Hosting client area. Navigate to your active hosting service and look for a "Log in to DirectAdmin" button or link.
2.  **Direct URL:** You might also be able to access it via a direct URL, often like `http://yourdomain.com:2222` or `https://serverhostname:2222`. Check your welcome email for the specific URL and login credentials (which might be different from your client area login).

## Navigating the Interface

Once logged in, you'll see the DirectAdmin dashboard. The layout typically includes:

*   **Top Menu:** Access to different user levels (if applicable), password changes, help resources, and logout.
*   **Main Categories:** Features are grouped into categories like "Account Manager," "Email Management," "Advanced Features," and "System Info & Files."
*   **Usage Statistics:** A summary of your resource usage (disk space, bandwidth, emails, databases, etc.).

## Common Tasks in DirectAdmin

Hereâ€™s how to perform some essential tasks:

### 1. File Management

*   Go to **System Info & Files -> File Manager**.
*   This interface allows you to navigate directories, upload files (using the `Upload Files` button), create new folders (`Create Folder`), delete files/folders, change permissions (`Set Permissions`), and edit text files (`Edit`).
*   Your website files should typically be uploaded to the `public_html` directory.

**Troubleshooting:**
*   **Upload Errors:** Check file size limits and ensure you have enough disk space. Verify you are uploading to the correct directory (`public_html` for the main domain).
*   **Permission Issues:** If you can't access files or your website shows errors, check file/folder permissions. Standard permissions are `755` for directories and `644` for files.

### 2. Email Account Management

*   Go to **Email Management -> Email Accounts**.
*   Click `Create Account`.
*   Enter the desired email username (e.g., `info`), set a strong password, and define a quota (mailbox size limit).
*   Click `Create Account`.
*   You can manage existing accounts (change passwords, quotas, delete) from the same screen.
*   Access webmail (like Roundcube or SquirrelMail) via the `Webmail` icon or by visiting `yourdomain.com/webmail`.

**Troubleshooting:**
*   **Cannot Send/Receive:** Verify DNS MX records are pointing correctly (see Domain Management docs). Check email client settings (server names, ports, authentication).
*   **Quota Exceeded:** Increase the mailbox quota or delete old emails.

### 3. Database Management (MySQL)

*   Go to **Account Manager -> MySQL Management**.
*   Click `Create New Database`.
*   Enter a database name prefix (e.g., `mydb`) and a database username suffix (e.g., `myuser`). DirectAdmin often prefixes these with your account username (e.g., `youruser_mydb`, `youruser_myuser`).
*   Generate or enter a strong password for the database user.
*   Click `Create Database`.
*   **phpMyAdmin:** Use the `phpMyAdmin` link (usually found in MySQL Management) to manage the database content directly (import/export data, run SQL queries, etc.).

**Troubleshooting:**
*   **Connection Errors:** Double-check the database name, username, password, and hostname (usually `localhost`) in your website's configuration file.
*   **Access Denied:** Ensure the database user has the correct privileges for the database.

### 4. Domain Management

*   **Domain Setup:** (Account Manager -> Domain Setup) Add addon domains or parked domains.
*   **Subdomain Management:** (Account Manager -> Subdomain Management) Create and manage subdomains (e.g., `blog.yourdomain.com`).
*   **DNS Management:** (Account Manager -> DNS Management) Manage DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc.) if your domain uses Xenum Hosting's nameservers.

### 5. Installing SSL Certificates

*   Go to **Account Manager -> SSL Certificates**.
*   DirectAdmin often integrates with Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates.
*   Select the option for "Free & automatic certificate from Let's Encrypt".
*   Choose the domain entries to secure (e.g., `yourdomain.com`, `www.yourdomain.com`).
*   Click `Save`.
*   Ensure "Force SSL with https redirect" is enabled after the certificate is installed.

**Troubleshooting:**
*   **Validation Errors:** Ensure your domain's DNS (A or CNAME records) correctly points to the server IP address. Let's Encrypt needs to verify domain ownership.
*   **Certificate Not Renewing:** Auto-renewal should be handled, but check the SSL Certificates section if you encounter issues.
